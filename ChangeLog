	for compatibility with 64-bit platforms.
	Released 0.10.0.

080427	Made the Oracle driver build compatible with Oracle Instant Client.

080311	Added --disable-shared and --disable-static options to
	the configure script.
	Released 0.9.0.

080306	Started integrating Freetds for Microsoft SQL and Sybase.
	Queries are submitted but returned values are not handed
	off to the callback.

080305	Oracle driver updated for 11g.
	Make sure that the Oracle driver treats null values as NULL.
	Released 0.8.0.

080229	Added support for shsql/quisp.
	Changed clilen type to socklen_t in sdbd.c.

051029	Added -c option to sdb_client to read an sql query from the
	command line rather than interactively.
	Released 0.6.2.

050219	In sdb_query: if the url refers to an already opened connection,

050110	Added support for Sqlite 3.
	Added another minimal example to the manpage.

	and Mysql drivers: don't segfault if sdb_close is called
	with a NULL argument.
	Released 0.5.5.

040423	Bugfix in the postgres driver: the closer should be called
	sdb_postgres_close. Released 0.5.4.

	Added patch for persistent Oracle connections
	from Denis Ovsienko <pilot@altlinux.ru>.

020828	Do not link sdb_client against .libs/libsdb.so. It breaks the

	sdb_client: Option -s changes the separator in output.
	Released 0.5.1.

020630	Added a driver by Lahcen EL HADDATI <elhaddati@hotmail.com>
	which accepts queries on plain text files in a SQL-like language.
	Released 0.5.0.

020621	Fixed bug in sdbd: null values in the result set caused the
	process to crash. Now it returns an empty string, which is wrong
	but better than crashing.
	Check memory allocations better in sdbd_driver.

020620	Mimer driver that actually works.
	Released 0.4.1.

020530	MiniSQL driver. Use --with-msql=/path/to/msql if it is not
	installed in /usr/local/Hughes.

	used for more than one query.

	protocol if it is implemented on both server and client.

020520	Added a check in sdb_query to call sdb_init if it hasn't already
	been done. This makes sdb_init calls from applications optional.

	users to any database supported by libsdb.

020503	Renamed all the drivers from XXX.c to XXX_driver.c.
	Wrote a new driver (sdbd_driver.c) for proxied queries.
	The new driver is designed so it can be compiled statically
	into an application without the rest of libsdb.

	tweaking to get the odbc driver running on Windows.
	Changed #include <mysql/mysql.h> to just #include <mysql.h>.
